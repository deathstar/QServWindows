# QServWindows
## Stable

Welcome to the QServWindows project page! Thanks to BudSpencer for porting the mod from Unix to Windows. 
The port had previously uncovered some GeoIP issues but they have all been fixed. GeoIP has been working
perfectly now. Also, the pban and ban system has been fixed. Please report bugs on the issues page, thanks.
